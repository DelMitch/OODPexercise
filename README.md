# Project Description  
For this project, I implemented the Chain of Responsibility design pattern. My program is a name generator modelled after 'What's Your [thing] Name?' charts and produces a three-part name based on the input given.  
  
The program prompts for the first letter of your forename & surname as well as your shirt color. Valid input for the forename and surname prompts include all strings that begin with an alphabetical character and nothing else. Valid input for the color prompt is the name of a color (chosen from a provided list) fully typed out and nothing else. The user is re-prompted in the case of invalid input. When all three prompts have received valid input, the user is shown their generated name.
